# OrderBY

used to sort rows based on column value, in either ascending or descending order.

# syntax-

select c1,c2 from table orderby c1 asc/desc;

asc - dedault order (ascending order)
desc - descending order

# we can also order by multiple columns
* this make sense when one column has duplicate entries.

Ex- select company,name,sales from table orderby company,sales;

select * from customer order by first_name asc;
select * from customer order by first_name desc;
select * from customer order by store_id;

select store_id,first_name, last_name from customer order by store_id,first_name desc;
