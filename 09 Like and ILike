# Like (use pattern matching)

for ex- mails end with @gmail.com , name starting with a, etc.

Like operator allows us to perform pattern matching against string data with use of wildcard characters:

Percent %  - matches any sequence of characters

Underscore _ - matches any single character.

example

all name starts with A , a

where name like 'A%'

where name like '%a'

Note - Like is case sensitive and Ilike is case insensitive.

# using underscrore allow us to replace just a single character 
ex- get all mission Impossible film
     where title like 'Mission Impossible _'
     
we can use multiple underscores

ex- ritik23, ritik45
where value like 'ritik_ _'

 
can also use for more complex pattern like

cheryl, theresa, sherri

where name like '_her%'

# Example

select * from customer
where first_name like 'J%'

select * from customer
where first_name ilike 'j%'

select count(*) from customer
where first_name ilike 'j%' and last_name like 'S%'

select * from customer
where first_name ilike '%er%'

select * from customer
where first_name ilike '_her%'

select * from customer
where first_name not like '_her%'

select * from customer
where first_name ilike 'a%' and last_name not ilike 'b%'
order by last_name
