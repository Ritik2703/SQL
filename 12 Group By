# Group BY

It allows us to aggregate columns per some category.

we need to choose a categorical column to GROUP BY.
categorical columns  are non continous.

ex- class 1, class2 , etc. (can still be numerical)

# example 

  select category_col, agg(data_col) from table 
  group by category_col;

  group by clause must appear right after a from or where statement..

  select category_col, agg(data_col) from table 
  where category_col !='A' 
  group by category_col;
  
  
  In the select statement, columns must either have an aggregate function or be in the group by call.
  
  select company, division, sum(sales) from finance_table
  where division in ('marketing','transport')
  group by company,division
  
  select company, sum(Sales) from finance_table
  group by company
  order by sum(sales)
  limit 5
