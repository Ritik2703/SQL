# Having

It allows us to filter after an aggregation has alreday taken place.

select company, sum(sales)
from finance
where company != 'Google'
group by company

we have already seen we can filter before executing the group by, but what if we want to filter based on sum(sales)

we can't use where to filter based off of aggregate results, because those happen after a where is executed

Solution is having

having allows us to use the aggregate result as a filter along with a group by

example

select company, sum(sales)
from finance
where company != 'Google'
group by company
having sum(sales) >  1000


select customer_id, sum(amount) from payment
group by customer_id
having sum(amount) > 100

select store_id, count(*) from customer
group by store_id
having count(*) > 300
