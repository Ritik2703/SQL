# AS
it allows us to create an alias for a column or result.

Syntax

select sum(column) as new_name from table

# example

select amount as rental_price from payment;

* The as operator gets executed at very end of query , we cant use alias inside where operator.

select customer_id, sum(amount) as total_spent from payment
group by customer_id

select customer_id, sum(amount) as total_spent from payment
group by customer_id
having sum(amount) > 100
