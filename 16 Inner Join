# what is Join?

Join allows us to combine multiple tables together


# an inner join will reslt with the set of records that match in both tables.

Syntax

select * from tableA
inner join tableB
on tableA.col_match = tableB.col_match

simple join also means inner join

in inner join table order won't matter.

# Example-

select * from payment
inner join customer
on payment.customer_id= customer.customer_id

select payment_id, payment.customer_id, first_name, last_name 
from customer
inner join payment
on payment.customer_id= customer.customer_id
