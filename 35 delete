# delete

we can use the delete clause to remove rows from a table

for ex-

delete from table where row_id=1

we can delete rows based on their presence in other tables.

delete from tablea
using tableb
where tablea.id= tableb.id


delete from table //delete all rows from table

we can also return using delete like update

delete from job 
where job_name= 'cow_boy'
returning job_id, job_name
