we can use case statement to only execute sql code when certain conditions are met.
this is very similar to if/else statements in other programming languages.

syntax-

CASE
   when condition1 then result1
   when condition2 then result2
   else some_other_result
END

ex-

select a,
case when a=1 then 'one'
     when a=2 then 'two'
  else 'other'
  end
  from test;
  
 
select customer_id,
case
    when (customer_id<=100) then 'premium'
	when (customer_id between 100 and 200) then 'plus'
	else 'normal'
end
from customer


select customer_id,
case customer_id
    when 1 then 'premium'
	when 2 then 'plus'
	else 'normal'
end as results
from customer

select rental_rate,
sum(case rental_rate
     when 0.99 then 1
	 else 0
end) as bargains,
sum(case rental_rate
     when 2.99 then 1
	 else 0
end) as regular
from film
group by rental_rate


select rental_rate,
sum(case rental_rate
     when 0.99 then 1
	 else 0
end) as bargains,
sum(case rental_rate
     when 2.99 then 1
	 else 0
end) as regular,
sum(case rental_rate
     when 4.99 then 1
	 else 0
end) as premium
from film
group by rental_rate
