during project we have combination of tables and conditions
instead of trying same query again and again we can create view to quickly see the query with simple call.


a view is a database object that stored query.
it is virtual table
it doesn't store data physically but stores query.

we can also update and alter existing views

create view customer_info as
select first_name,last_name,address from customer
inner join address
on customer.address_id = address.address_id

select * from customer_info

create or replace view customer_info as 
select first_name,last_name,address,district from customer
inner join address
on customer.address_id = address.address_id

alter view customer_info rename to c_info

drop view c_info
